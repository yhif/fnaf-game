                        <p>FNAF 2 is the thrilling sequel to the original Five Nights at Freddy's, developed by Scott Cawthon and released by ScottGames in 2014.

With limited power and a complex camera system, surviving each night from midnight to 6 a.m. requires strategy and quick reflexes. Whether you're a longtime fan or new to the series, FNAF 2 offers an immersive and spine-chilling adventure that keeps you on the edge of your seat.</p>

                    <div>
                        <h3>Constantly Check the Cameras</h3>

                    <div>
