Whether you're a longtime fan or new to the series, FNAF 2 offers an immersive and spine-chilling adventure that keeps you on the edge of your seat.</p>

                    <div>
                        <h3>Constantly Check the Cameras</h3>
                        <p>Regularly monitoring the camera feeds in FNAF 2 allows you to stay informed about animatronic movements. This awareness helps you react promptly to any threats.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h3>Listen for Audio Cues</h3>
                        <p>FNAF 2 features audio cues that signal animatronic activities. Paying attention to these sounds can alert you to imminent attacks, giving you the time to respond.</p>

                        <h3>Use Flashlight Sparingly</h3>
                        <p>The flashlight in FNAF 2 has limited power. Use it only when necessary to check dark areas or fend off specific animatronics like Foxy, ensuring you don't drain the battery too quickly.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h3>Prioritize Music Box Maintenance</h3>
