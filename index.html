                        <h2>What is FNAF Five Nights at Freddy's</h2>
                        <p>Five Nights at Freddy's (FNAF) stands as a groundbreaking survival horror phenomenon that revolutionized the gaming industry. Created by the visionary developer Scott Cawthon, this masterpiece combines psychological horror with strategic gameplay, creating an experience that has captivated millions of players worldwide. Set in the seemingly innocent Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, players step into the shoes of a night security guard facing unimaginable horrors when the restaurant's animatronic mascots come to life with sinister intentions.</p>

                        <p>The game's innovative approach to horror lies in its unique premise: players must survive five nights while managing limited resources and fending off hostile animatronics. During each night shift, you're confined to a small security office, armed only with security cameras, door controls, and a finite power supply. The animatronic characters - Freddy Fazbear, Bonnie, Chica, and Foxy - move freely throughout the facility, becoming increasingly aggressive as the nights progress. Your survival depends on strategic resource management, quick thinking, and the ability to remain calm under extreme pressure.</p>
                            
                        <p>FNAF's narrative depth sets it apart in the horror genre. The game masterfully weaves an intricate story through subtle environmental storytelling, mysterious phone calls, and hidden mini-games. Players uncover dark secrets about the restaurant's history, including the infamous "Missing Children Incident" and the "Bite of '87," which add layers of psychological horror to the gameplay experience. The series has expanded to include multiple sequels, each adding new dimensions to the lore while introducing innovative gameplay mechanics and locations.</p>
                            
                        <p>The franchise's success has transcended gaming, spawning a multimedia empire that includes bestselling novels, merchandise, and a highly anticipated feature film. From its humble beginnings as an indie game in 2014 to its current status as a cultural phenomenon, FNAF continues to evolve and terrify new generations of players. The game's unique blend of resource management, psychological horror, and compelling storytelling has established it as a cornerstone of modern horror gaming, inspiring countless imitators while maintaining its position as the genre's defining experience.</p>

                        <p>Today, FNAF represents more than just a game - it's a testament to the power of innovative game design and storytelling. Its influence can be seen across the gaming industry, particularly in how it revolutionized the way horror games approach tension-building and player engagement. Whether you're a seasoned horror fan or new to the genre, Five Nights at Freddy's offers an unforgettable experience that continues to set the standard for horror gaming excellence.</p>

                    How to Play FNAF
                </h2>
                <div class="content">
                    
                <div>
                    <h3>Master the Security System</h3>
                    <p>Efficiently monitor the security camera network to track animatronic movements. Switch between camera feeds strategically to maintain awareness of all potential threats. Each camera view provides crucial information about the animatronics' locations and patterns, helping you anticipate their next moves.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>Strategic Door and Light Management</h3>
                    <p>Control the security doors and lights with precision timing. Use the lights to check blind spots in the doorways, and close doors only when absolutely necessary to conserve power. Remember that each action consumes valuable electricity, so timing is crucial for survival.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>Master Sound Recognition</h3>
                    <p>Develop acute audio awareness to detect animatronic movement. Different sounds indicate specific threats: footsteps signal movement, mechanical whirring suggests nearby presence, and silence can be just as telling. Your ability to interpret these audio cues is vital for survival.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>Power Conservation</h3>
                    <p>Carefully manage your limited power supply throughout the night. Each electrical system - cameras, doors, and lights - drains power. Monitor your power percentage and adapt your strategy as resources dwindle. Running out of power leaves you defenseless against the animatronics.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>Learn Enemy Patterns</h3>
                    <p>Study and memorize each animatronic's unique behavior patterns. Freddy follows specific routes, Foxy needs constant monitoring, and Bonnie and Chica have distinct movement preferences. Understanding these patterns is key to predicting and countering their attacks.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>Time Management</h3>
                    <p>Survive from 12 AM until 6 AM while managing multiple threats. Each hour brings new challenges and increased animatronic aggression. Develop efficient routines and adapt your strategy as the night progresses to ensure your survival until dawn.</p>

                    Tips for Playing FNAF
                </h2>
                <div class="content">
                    
                <div>
                    <h3>Strategic Power Management</h3>
                    <p>Master efficient power usage to survive until dawn. Only use doors when animatronics are nearby, minimize camera usage to essential checks, and use lights sparingly. Remember: running out of power before 6 AM leaves you completely vulnerable to attacks.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>Understand Animatronic Behaviors</h3>
                    <p>Each animatronic has distinct patterns and behaviors. Freddy moves in the darkness and plays music, Bonnie approaches from the left, Chica from the right, and Foxy needs regular monitoring to prevent his sprint. Learning these patterns is crucial for survival.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>Develop Quick Reactions</h3>
                    <p>Speed and precision are essential. Practice quick camera switches, door closures, and light checks. Develop muscle memory for controls and establish efficient monitoring routines. Every second counts when an animatronic is approaching.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>Master Audio Cues</h3>
                    <p>Sound is your best ally. Learn to recognize footsteps, laughs, and mechanical noises. Different sounds indicate specific animatronics and their locations. Use headphones for the best audio experience and increased survival chances.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>Maintain Situational Awareness</h3>
                    <p>Keep track of multiple threats simultaneously. Monitor high-risk areas like Pirate Cove regularly, check blind spots frequently, and maintain awareness of your power level. Developing a systematic approach to surveillance is key.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>Stay Focused Under Pressure</h3>
                    <p>Panic is your worst enemy. When multiple animatronics are active, stay calm and methodical. Prioritize immediate threats, manage resources carefully, and stick to your strategy even in intense situations. Mental composure is as important as game mechanics.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>Learn from Failures</h3>
                    <p>Each game over is a learning opportunity. Analyze what went wrong, adjust your strategy, and try different approaches. Success in FNAF comes from experience and adaptation to various situations and animatronic patterns.</p>
                </div>
